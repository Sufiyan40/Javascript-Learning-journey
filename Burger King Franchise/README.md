# Burger King Franchise

This project is a fun and interactive **Food Order Simulator** that lets users select their favorite food items (like Burger, Fries, and Drink) and place an order. Once the order is placed, a simulated preparation time with a loading animation appears, and then the selected food item is displayed along with a unique Order ID.

## Features

- **Food Selection**: Choose from a selection of food items: Burger, Fries, and Drink.
- **Random Order ID**: Each order generates a unique random Order ID.
- **Simulated Order Preparation**: Includes a loading animation and a "Preparing your order..." message to mimic real-world waiting time.
- **Dynamic Image Display**: Shows an image of the selected food item once the order is "prepared."

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Structure of the webpage.
- **CSS**: Styling for layout, buttons, loader animations, and responsiveness.
- **JavaScript**: Logic for handling order placement, timeouts for loading simulation, and dynamic content updates.
